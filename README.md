ðŸ“Š SaaS Revenue & Customer Behavior Dashboard
Executive Review
This research examines a growing SaaS company's user subscription behavior, recurring revenue, and churn trends over a 17-month period.  With more than 500 clients spread across several nations and subscription options, the dataset offers a strong basis for comprehending revenue dynamics and customer retention trends.  To combine important indicators including Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), customer tenure, plan performance, and geographic distribution, an interactive dashboard was created using Tableau.  In order to maximize revenue growth and customer lifetime value, stakeholders can monitor business health, detect churn threats, and make well-informed strategic decisions thanks to the analysis's clear and actionable insights.

Project Background
Long-term viability for every SaaS company hinges on reducing churn and increasing recurring income.  Nevertheless, a lot of businesses find it difficult to convert unstructured subscription data into useful business analytics.  Beginning with a raw dataset that included customer IDs, signup dates, plan kinds (Basic, Pro, and Enterprise), monthly income in pounds sterling, country of origin, churn dates, and customer duration, this project aimed to close this gap.  Before being imported into Tableau for more in-depth visualization and analysis, the data was cleaned in Excel to guarantee accuracy and consistency.

Insight Deep Dive
The analysis reveals several key insights about the companyâ€™s performance and growth opportunities. Over the 17-month period, Monthly Recurring Revenue grew steadily from approximately Â£25,000 in January 2024 to Â£55,000 by May 2025, representing an increase of more than 120 percent. The Enterprise plan emerged as the largest contributor to revenue, generating an average of Â£30,000 per month and accounting for over half of total MRR. The Pro plan delivered around Â£18,000 per month, while the Basic plan contributed the remaining share, highlighting the significant impact of premium plan upgrades on overall revenue.

Geographically, the United Kingdom accounts for the largest portion of the customer base, representing roughly 42 percent of all subscribers, followed by the United States at 30 percent. The remaining customers are distributed across Europe, Asia, and Oceania. Industry segmentation indicates that Enterprise plans are especially popular among clients in the finance and healthcare sectors, whereas the Basic plan tends to attract startups and education-related customers.

Churn trends show notable variation across different subscription tiers. The overall churn rate stands at 9 percent; however, this figure drops to just 4 percent for Enterprise plan customers, who are typically locked into longer-term agreements. In contrast, Pro plan subscribers have a churn rate of around 10 percent, and the Basic plan segment exhibits the highest churn at 18 percent, underscoring the greater price sensitivity of these users. A significant churn spike occurred in July 2024, when the churn rate briefly climbed to 15 percent following a pricing adjustment for the Pro plan, highlighting how sensitive retention can be to changes in pricing strategy.

The customer tenure analysis further reinforces the value of strong retention efforts. The average tenure across all customers is approximately 14 months, but Enterprise plan customers stay on average for 20 months, compared to 15 months for Pro subscribers and only nine months for Basic users. Customers with a tenure exceeding 18 months contribute roughly 65 percent of total revenue, making them vital to the companyâ€™s financial stability and long-term growth.

Taken together, these insights emphasize the importance of focusing on strategies that encourage customers to upgrade to higher-value plans, while simultaneously addressing the factors driving churn among Basic and Pro plan users. By leveraging this dashboard, stakeholders can quickly pinpoint high-risk segments, monitor revenue performance by market or industry, and tailor retention initiatives to maximize customer lifetime value.
